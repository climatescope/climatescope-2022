# Development

## Install Project Dependencies
To set up the development environment for this website, you'll need to install the following on your system:

- [Node](http://nodejs.org/) v8.11 (To manage multiple node versions we recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) Package manager

### Install Application Dependencies

If you use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), activate the desired Node version:
```
nvm install
```

Install Node modules:
```
yarn install
```

or
```
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run:

```
yarn export
```

or 

```
npm run export
```

This will build the navigation, build the optimized images, build the next app, and export this app as a static website into the `/out` folder, which can then be deployed. Once you have exported the app, you can test it locally by running:

```
yarn serve
```

or

```
npm run serve
```

### Javascript configurations and environment variables

In order to run the app, you will need to provide a site url and a mapbox token, as well as a mailchimp address. You can do this via a `.env.local` file.

```
SITE_URL=https://www.global-climatescope.org/
MAPBOX_TOKEN=
MAILCHIMP_ADDRESS=
```
