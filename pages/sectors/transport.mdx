## Battery pack prices

Since 2010, battery prices have fallen 89% and are nearing levels where the upfront costs of EVs can start to be competitive with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICE) without subsidies. Battery prices fell again in 2021, dropping 6% year-over-year to $132/kWh, due to growing order sizes from leading manufacturers, higher battery electric vehicle sales and the introduction of new cell and pack designs.

## EV charging infrastructure

There were over 1.8 million installed public charging connectors globally at the end of 2021, an increase of 35% from 2020. Mainland China remained the global leader on public charging, with 1.15 million cumulative installed connectors by the end of 2021.

## EV share of vehicle sales by market

In over half of the global car market, EV adoption is still below 10% of sales. This includes countries like the US and Japan, which are still looking to catch up. Roughly 30% of the global car market is in countries where EV adoption is currently very low.
